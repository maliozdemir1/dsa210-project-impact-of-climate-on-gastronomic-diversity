# üçΩÔ∏è Impact of Climate and Weather Conditions on Regional Gastronomic Diversity in Turkey

This project explores the relationship between Turkey‚Äôs diverse climatic conditions and its regional food culture using data-driven methods.

## 1. Project Overview  
This study investigates whether and how regional climate conditions influence the caloric intensity and category distribution (meat-based vs vegetable-based, etc.) of traditional cuisine across Turkish provinces.  
The underlying hypothesis is that climate acts as an environmental driver, shaping culinary patterns, which in turn reflect in the caloric profile of regional diets.

## üçÄ Motivation  

As a student who is coming from a gastronomically rich city -Afyonkarahisar-, I‚Äôve always been fascinated by how geography and environment shape what people eat. For example, in Afyon the main dietary plans are based on calorie-densed dishes like B√ºkme, Katmer or Lokul classified as pastry and bakery. Compared to Afyon, my second home city -ƒ∞zmir- prefers lighter and low-calorie meals like vegetable dishes more often. Then, I realized throughout the travels between Afyon and ƒ∞zmir that there might correlations between caloric intensity of the foods and geographical features of the regions in our country.

This observation led me to wonder whether these gastronomic differences are random cultural choices or if they have deeper environmental roots ‚Äî specifically, whether climate conditions such as temperature and humidity have influenced the evolution of regional cuisines in Turkey.  

By analyzing this relationship, I aim to explore how environmental factors can shape long-term dietary patterns, while also strengthening my skills in data preprocessing, visualization, and regression modeling using real-world open datasets. 

Note: I want to use these analysis while I'm going to open my dream restaurant in the future as a student who is crazy about food.

## 3. Research Questions  
- **RQ1:** Do provinces with colder and/or more humid climates tend to have more calorie-dense -meat-based, pastry-heavy- traditional cuisines compared to warmer regions?  
- **RQ2:** How strongly are climatic indicators like average temperature, annual precipitation correlated with the ‚ÄúCaloric Gastronomic Index‚Äù of a region?

## 4. Hypotheses  

**Null Hypothesis 1 (H‚ÇÄ‚ÇÅ):** Regional climate conditions do not have a significant impact on the caloric intensity of traditional cuisines.  
**Alternative Hypothesis 1 (H‚ÇÅ‚ÇÅ):** Colder or more humid regions have significantly higher caloric intensity in their traditional cuisines compared to warmer regions.  

**Null Hypothesis 2 (H‚ÇÄ‚ÇÇ):** The type distribution of regional cuisines such as meat-based, vegetable-based, pastry, dessert, etc. is independent of regional climate conditions.  
**Alternative Hypothesis 2 (H‚ÇÅ‚ÇÇ):** Climate conditions significantly influence the type distribution of traditional foods.

## 5. Datasets & Sources  

In order to maintain this analysis, we will use these datasets and sources:

 **Traditional Food Data**: List of regional traditional foods by province, categorized by type  [Turkish Patent and Trademark Office ‚Äì Geographical Indications Database](https://ci.turkpatent.gov.tr/) 
 
 **Climate Data**: Provincial average annual climate indicators taken from Turkish State Meteorological Service (MGM) / [Open-Meteo API](https://open-meteo.com/) 
 
 **Food Composition Data**: Average energy values (kcal/100 g) by food category to compute the Caloric Gastronomic Index [TURKOMP](https://www.turkomp.gov.tr/) & [USDA FoodData Central](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/) 
 
 **Control Variables**: Provincial data such as urbanization rate, tourism density, population density  [Turkish Statistical Institute (T√úƒ∞K)](https://data.tuik.gov.tr/)
